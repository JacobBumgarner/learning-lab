# Data Structures
## Basic
### Arrays
Arrays are data structures used to store an ordered collection of items in *contiguous* (consecutive) memory. Arrays can be static, where the size is defined at compile time, or dynamic, where the size can change during runtime. Arrays can be multi-dimensional. Data in arrays are accessed via indexing (e.g., Python zero-based indexing). At the memory level, information for each element is calculated using the base address and the size of the array data types (e.g., int8).

Because of the fixed data type and sizing constraints, arrays are highly effecient and performant data structures.

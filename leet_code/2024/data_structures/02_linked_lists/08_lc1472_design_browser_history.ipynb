    "# 1472. Design Browser History\n",
    "Design a browser history class object with the ability to step forward and back in history and add new url visits.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a new visit is added, the forward history is cleared.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the number of forward/back steps is beyond the history limit, return the head/end node accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notes\n",
    "My solution will follow an O(n) time and space complexity. The `visit` operation is O(1) time complexity, but the `forward` and `back` operations are linearly dependent on the size of `steps`.\n",
    "\n",
    "One additional thought that I have about the browser class object created outside of Python would need to handle garbage collection for visits added anywhere other than the `end` node. I'll ignore this for the Python solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution Thoughts\n",
    "First, I'll create a `Visit` class that contains the `url`, `prev`, and `next` visits.\n",
    "\n",
    "`__init__` and `visit` are straight forward; they create a new `Visit` object and point them to the correct location.\n",
    "\n",
    "`back` and `forward` will iterate over the number of input steps; the loops will `break` if the `prev` or `next` nodes are `None`, respectively. At each iteration, the `current_node` of the main class will be updated.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `current_node` will be returned at the end of each function."

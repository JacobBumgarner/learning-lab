    "Rather than including a list of conditionals at the beginning of the function, instead I can create a `pre_node` that points to nothing. I will then initialize a `current_node` as the `pre_node`, and then iterate over the input lists until either of them are `None`.\n",

    "\n",
    "Once the loop is exited because either the `list1` or `list2` nodes have become `None`, which means the `current_node.next` has also become `None`. As such, we will need to reconnect the `current_node` to `list1` if it is not `None`, and `list2` otherwise (which may also be `None`).\n",
    "\n",

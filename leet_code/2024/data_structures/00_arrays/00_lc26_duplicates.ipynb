    "# 26. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array\n",
    "Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same. Then return the number of unique elements in nums.\n",

    "A slightly improved approach would be to use a two-pointer approach, where the right pointer moves forward to check if the values are the same as the left pointer. The right pointer would move until the value is no longer the same as the left pointer, and then the array from the start of the right pointer to the end would be shifted to one to the right of the left pointer index.\n",

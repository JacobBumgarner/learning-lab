In descriptive statistics, variance is used to describe the distribution of a
sample or population. In inferential statistics, variance is a measurement used
to measure the expected variability of a *random variable^a^*.

*^a^Random variables* are functions that map sample spaces (e.g., $\{ H, T \}$ is
the sample space of a coin flip) to a measurable space (e.g., $\{ H: 0, T: 1
\}$). By definition, a random variable generates values that vary *randomly*

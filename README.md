# Learning Lab
Hi! Thanks for checking out this repository. This is my public learning lab where I upload notebooks that I've used to teach myself or reinforce various statistical methods, machine learning algorithms, or deep learning models.

The easiest way that I learn new topics is breaking them down the the basics and then teaching the concepts to others. [Richard Feynman](https://www.colorado.edu/artssciences-advising/resource-library/life-skills/the-feynman-technique-in-academic-coaching) really knew what he was talking about.

Please feel free to create issues in the resository if you find anything wrong with the examples or have any suggestions for improvement.

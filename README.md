# Learning Lab
This is my public learning lab where I upload notebooks that I've used to teach myself about or reinforce my understanding of various statistical methods, machine learning algorithms, or deep learning models.

The easiest way that for me to learn or improve my understanding of topics is breaking them down to the basics and then teaching the concepts to others. [Richard Feynman](https://www.colorado.edu/artssciences-advising/resource-library/life-skills/the-feynman-technique-in-academic-coaching) really knew what he was talking about.

Please feel free to create issues in the resository if you find anything wrong with the examples or have any suggestions for improvement.
